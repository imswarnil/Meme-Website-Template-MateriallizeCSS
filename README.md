## Why I Have Created this template what was running in my mind
This website can be utilise as meme news these days memes are part of our life, we laugh, share, tag our friends, so i came up with a idea why not create simple website where we can share information about meme ( inspired by Behind the meme ) we can share story how specific meme become viral or story behind meme. i have added meme cards where you can add image and short description about meme if user is instersted in that particular meme he can read more, i have added one blog post page also.
